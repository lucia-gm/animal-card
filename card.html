				<p>Commonly known as the Westie is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft white undercoat. They have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect. It is a hardy breed, and can be stubborn, leading to issues with training.</p>
